<ul>
  <li>Introduction to the Social Network Website Project</li>
  <li>All Posts (Logged out): Even when logged out, the user can still view the page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first</li>
  <li>Login: The user logs in to use the social network.</li>
  <li>Profile Page: When logged in, the user can go to their profile to see their information and posts, and they can also view their followers.</li>
  <li>Profile Page (Follow” or “Unfollow”): The profile page, when it belongs to a user other than yourself, displays a 'Follow' or 'Unfollow' button.</li>
  <li>Following: The “Following” link in the navigation bar takes the user to a page where they see all posts made by users they currently follow.</li>
  <li>Followers: Displays the followers the user has.</li>
  <li>New Post: Users who are logged in can create a new text-based post by entering text into the text area and clicking the 'Create Post' button.</li>
  <li>Edit Post: By clicking on the edit icon, the user can edit their own posts.</li>
  <li>Delete Post: By clicking on the delete icon, the user can delete their own posts.</li>
  <li>“Like” and “Unlike”: The user can click the heart button on any post to toggle whether or not they 'like' that post.</li>
  <li>New Comment: Users who are logged in can create a new text-based comment by entering text into the text area and clicking the 'Submit Comment' button.</li>
  <li>Edit Comment: By clicking on the edit icon, the user can edit their own comments.</li>
  <li>Delete Comment: By clicking on the delete icon, the user can delete their own comments.</li>
  <li>Pagination: On pages that display posts, only 10 posts per page are shown. When there are more than ten posts, a 'Next' button appears to take the user to the next page of posts that is older than the current page of posts, and it can also return to the previous page.</li>
  <li>New Post (Logged out): If the user is not logged in, they cannot create a post.</li>
